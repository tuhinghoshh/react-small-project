        JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the
        ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language
        for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming
        language, and is currently the most popular programming language in
        use.[1] JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as
        interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live
        clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in
        server-side programming through platforms like Node.js,[2] or "embedded"
        in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks
        the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers Despite the
        similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the
        programming language Java. Though the names of both languages are
        trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different
        design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated
        organizations.
